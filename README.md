# Portfolio Final

The purpose of this website is to showcase the progress I have made in this class over the course of the semester. It will allow me to put my coding skills to use as I combine them into this final project.

#### Technologies

The technologies used in for this page include HTML, CSS, and Markdown

#### Structure

This repository is structured into three main pages:

1. index.html - this serves as the portfolio home page
2. example.html - this is the first page showcasing my previous coding work. It is from the "Style my Personality" assignment and shows what I think the portfolio of Spongebob Squarepants might look like.
3. example2.html - this is the second page showcasing my pervious coding work. It if from the "Fictional Business Website" assignment, and while I did not write the content, I did write the coding involved for it.

From there, the repository includes a style.md folder explaining my stylistic choices and how they were made.
