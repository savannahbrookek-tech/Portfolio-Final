    <h1>Savannah Kimball</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Savannah Kimball, and I am studying English with a minor in
      Education here at NMSU. I'm currently a junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been writing for as long as I can remember, and my dream is to one day become an author. Right now, I'm working on getting into the editing and publishing industry in order to both gain publishing-related experience and to have a stable job along with my writing.

    <h2>Sample 1: Spongebob's Portfolio</h2>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="example.html"
            >First Sample</a>
          <p> I was the only person working on this project. The point of the assignment was to create a styled portfolio that matched the personality of a charater of our choosing. My character was Spongebob, and for this project, I fosuced on bright yellow and blue colors to match both the show and his personality. This was an exercise in css coding and styling.</p>

    <h2>Sample 2: The Krusty Krab Website</h2>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="example2.html"
            >Second Sample</a>
          <p> I worked on thi project with two other people, but for this page, I did all the HTML and CSS coding. This project's purpose was to create a business website for a fictional business of our choosing, and my group chose the Krusty Krab from Spongebob. For this project, we focused on images from the show and adding working navigation links to our various pages.</p>
