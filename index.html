    <h1>Savannah Kimball</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Savannah Kimball, and I am studying English with a minor in
      Education here at NMSU. I'm currently a junior.

    <p>
      I have been writing for as long as I can remember, and my dream is to one day become an author. Right now, I'm working on getting into the editing and publishing industry in order to both gain publishing-related experience and to have a stable job along with my writing.

    <h2>Sample 1: Spongebob's Portfolio</h2>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
<a href="example.html">First Sample</a>
          <p> I was the only person working on this project, and it was one of the assignments given in my Web Design class. The point of the assignment was to create a styled portfolio that matched the personality of a fictional charater of our choosing. My character was Spongebob, and for this project, I fosuced on bright yellow and blue colors to match both the show and his personality. Since spoongebob is yellow and lives in the ocean, which is blue, I felt it fit him very well. This was an exercise in css coding and styling. It helped me practice my formatting for HTML, as well as my CSS skills. </p>

    <h2>Sample 2: The Krusty Krab Website</h2>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="example2.html">Second Sample</a>
          <p> I worked on this project with two other people, but for this page, I did the HTML and CSS coding. This was another assignment for my Web Design class. This project's purpose was to create a business website for a fictional business of our choosing, and my group chose the Krusty Krab from Spongebob. For this project, we focused on images from the show (such as Krabby Patties) and adding working navigation links to our various pages. The colors were kept fairky simple to create more emphasis on the images and content we'd chosen. </p>
