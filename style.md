# Style

Overall, my stylistic choices focused mainly on allowing for creativity while also meeting the objectives of haing two working pages and showing off my previous work from our class. I wanted to reflect my personality and who I am, as well as how I've grown this semester.

### Colors/Images

For the colors, I focused on pinks and reds because I often feel that a sort of 'Valentine's Day' aesthetic fits my personality well. This is also why I used so much imagery of hearts when drawing the art for my portfolio to create this sort of love-core look.

### Layout

I kept my name and bio first on the page to act as a sort of introduction. Why would anyone be interested in seeing my work if they don't even know who I am? Then I placed my navigation links below that to show my work, followed by my artistic images at the bottom because, while they may not provide additional practical information, they add to the overall aesthetic and look of the website.

### Voice

I tried to keep my voice informal but clear for this portfolio, as again, I feel like that reflects me best. I didn't want to add too much or too little text when writing my content, so I opted for something in the middle.

### Format

For the format, I wanted to make sure the words were easily big enough to see, and that the difference between headings and paragraphs were clear enough. This is why I made the headings bigger in general, but in a way that still matched one another.

### Notes

Images were always accompanied by alternate text for accessability purposes.
