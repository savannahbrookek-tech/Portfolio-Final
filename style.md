# Style

Overall, my stylistic choices focused mainly on allowing for creativity while also meeting the objectives of haing two working pages and showing off my previous work from our class. I wanted to reflect my personality and who I am, as well as how I've grown this semester.

### Colors/Images

For the colors, I focused on pinks and reds because I often feel that a sort of 'Valentine's Day' aesthetic fits my personality well. This is also why I used so much imagery of hearts when drawing the art for my portfolio to create this sort of love-core look.

### Layout

### Voice

I tried to keep my voice informal but clear for this portfolio, as again, I feel like that reflects me best. I didn't want to add too much or too little text when writing my content, so I opted for something in the middle.

### Format

### Notes

Images were always accompanied by alternate text for accessability purposes.
